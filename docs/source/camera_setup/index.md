# Camera Setup

This section describes how to set up Intel RealSense D435 cameras for FR3. First, we can 3D print a stand for the camera. The STL file (`Panda_RealSenseD435_Camera_Mount.STL`) can be found [here](https://download.franka.de/panda_camera_mount.zip). After attaching the stand and the camera to the robot, we first need to install the packages required to read images from the RealSense camera. 

## Check the SDK and Firmware Version

To ensure everything works, we first need to check the SDK version we plan to install the recommended firmware version. 

## ROS Package Installation

The installation instructions of the ROS package can be found [here](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros/tree/ros1-legacy#installation-instructions)
